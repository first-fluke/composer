# FEEDBACK-LOOPS.md — Feedback Loop Design

> Agents generate signals for system improvement through repeated failures.
> If those signals are not captured, the same mistakes repeat indefinitely.

## 1. Static vs Dynamic Context

| Type | Location | Update Frequency | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Static** | `AGENTS.md` | Manually updated by humans | Immutable rules always read on agent entry |
| **Dynamic** | Logs, metrics, CI results | Real-time | Basis for decisions during agent execution |

### Single Source of Truth

The repository is the single source of truth.

- Rules live in `AGENTS.md` or files under `docs/`.
- Rules that exist only in Slack messages, verbal agreements, or wikis are invisible to agents.
- All constraints agreed upon with agents must be committed to the repository.

## 2. Agent Failure to AGENTS.md Update Cycle

If an agent repeatedly makes the same mistake, it is a signal of missing context.

### Cycle

```
Agent failure
    |
Pattern detected (same mistake 2+ times)
    |
Add explicit prohibition rule to AGENTS.md or docs/architecture/CONSTRAINTS.md
    |
Include fix instructions in error message (so the agent can self-correct)
    |
CI detects the same violation -> automatic blocking
```

### Error Message Design Principles

Simple warnings do not enable agents to self-correct.

```
# Bad example
Error: import violation

# Good example
Error: 'orchestrator' imports from 'agent-runner' — dependency direction violation.
Allowed direction: orchestrator -> workspace-manager -> agent-runner
Fix: Instead of importing agent-runner directly from orchestrator,
     call it through the workspace-manager interface.
Reference: docs/architecture/LAYERS.md
```

An agent must be able to self-correct by reading only the error message.
(See `AGENTS.md` Section Conventions — Error message principles)

### CI Violation to CONSTRAINTS.md Update

Violations caught by CI are patterns that automated scanners missed.
Upon discovery, immediately add them to `docs/architecture/CONSTRAINTS.md` and mechanize as lint rules.

## 3. Metric Collection

Track agent throughput and harness efficiency numerically.
Without metrics, there is no way to know whether improvement is occurring.

| Metric | Collection Point | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Time to PR | `git log` (issue assignment -> PR creation timestamp) | Decreasing trend |
| CI pass rate | GitHub Actions execution logs | > 90% |
| Review time per PR | GitHub API (review submitted timestamp) | Decreasing trend |
| Documentation freshness | `git log AGENTS.md` latest commit date | < 7 days |

### Documentation Freshness Threshold

If `AGENTS.md` has not been updated for more than 7 days, the feedback loop is broken.
Interpret this as a signal that agent failure patterns are not being reflected.

Metric collection point details: `docs/specs/observability.md`

## 4. Feedback Loop Health Check

The feedback loop is operating normally when all of the following are satisfied.

- [ ] Last commit to `AGENTS.md` is within 7 days
- [ ] CI pass rate is above 90% over the past 2 weeks
- [ ] No pattern where an agent triggers the same lint error 3+ times consecutively
- [ ] CONSTRAINTS.md updated within 24 hours of discovering a new violation pattern
