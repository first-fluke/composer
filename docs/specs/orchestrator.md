# Orchestrator

> Responsibility: Handle webhook events, manage state machine, process retry queue.
> The core Symphony component. Sole authority over in-memory runtime state.

Domain models: see `domain-models.md` (Issue, Workspace, RunAttempt, RetryEntry, OrchestratorRuntimeState).

---

## State Ownership

The Orchestrator exclusively owns `OrchestratorRuntimeState`.
No other component mutates this state directly. Access is only through the Orchestrator API.

```
OrchestratorRuntimeState (single instance, in-memory)
  isRunning        : boolean
  activeWorkspaces : Map<issueId, Workspace>
  retryQueue       : RetryEntry[]
  lastEventAt      : ISO8601 | null
```

---

## Event-Driven Flow

The Orchestrator is event-driven via Linear webhooks.
On startup, it performs a one-time sync to recover any events missed while offline.

### Startup Sync

```
1. TrackerClient.fetchIssuesByState([todo, inProgress])   ← one-time API call
   → current Todo + In Progress issue list

2. For each issue:
   a. If Todo → handleIssueTodo (transition to InProgress, then start agent)
   b. If InProgress → handleIssueInProgress (start agent directly)

3. Process retry queue (see Retry Queue section)

4. Start HTTP server on Config.server.port
   → /webhook  — receive Linear events
   → /status   — runtime state
   → /health   — health check

5. Ready to receive webhook events
```

### Webhook Event Handling

```
POST /webhook received:
  1. TrackerClient.verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature)
     → invalid signature: 403 + warn log, discard

  2. TrackerClient.parseWebhookEvent(payload)
     → extract: action, issueId, stateId

  3. Route by event:
     a. Issue moved to TODO:
        → handleIssueTodo:
          - Check if already in activeWorkspaces (skip if duplicate)
          - Check concurrency limit (queue in retryQueue if maxParallel reached)
          - TrackerClient.updateIssueState(issueId, inProgress)
          - Delegate to handleIssueInProgress

     b. Issue moved to IN_PROGRESS:
        → handleIssueInProgress:
          - Check if already in activeWorkspaces (skip if duplicate)
          - Check concurrency limit (queue if maxParallel reached)
          - WorkspaceManager.create(issue) if no workspace
          - AgentRunner.spawn(issue, workspace)
          - Add to activeWorkspaces

     c. Issue moved OUT of IN_PROGRESS (DONE, CANCELLED, etc.):
        → If running in activeWorkspaces, AgentRunner.kill(attemptId)
        → Remove from activeWorkspaces
        → WorkspaceManager.cleanup(workspace) if configured

  4. Return 200 OK (acknowledge receipt)
```

### Agent Completion Handling

```
AgentRunner.spawn() resolves:
  → exitCode == 0:
    - Workspace.status = "done", remove from activeWorkspaces
    - TrackerClient.addIssueComment(issueId, workSummary)  ← best-effort
    - TrackerClient.updateIssueState(issueId, done)

  → exitCode != 0 (recoverable):
    - Add RetryEntry to retry queue
    - If max retries exceeded:
      - TrackerClient.addIssueComment(issueId, errorReport)
      - TrackerClient.updateIssueState(issueId, cancelled)
```

---

## Restart Recovery

On restart, in-memory state is reset. A one-time Linear API call restores state.

```
1. Initialize: activeWorkspaces = {}, retryQueue = []
2. Startup sync: fetch Todo + In Progress issues from Linear (one-time)
3. Todo → transition to InProgress, then start agent
   InProgress → start agent directly
4. If prior RunAttempt exists with no LiveSession:
   → process terminated while Orchestrator was down → add to retry queue
5. Start HTTP server, ready for webhook events
```

**Orphan process handling:** If LiveSession.lastHeartbeat exceeds `2 * agent.timeout`, treat as orphan. Terminate OS process, add to retry queue.

---

## Retry Queue

```
On failure:
  RetryEntry {
    issueId      = issue.id
    attemptCount = previous attempt count + 1
    nextRetryAt  = now + (backoffSec * 2^(attemptCount-1))  // exponential backoff
    lastError    = runner exit code + last error message
  }

  if attemptCount >= config.agent.retryPolicy.maxAttempts:
    → do not add to retry queue
    → error log: "Max retry attempts reached for issue {identifier}"
    → Workspace.status = "failed"
```

Retry queue is processed:
- After startup sync completes
- After each webhook event is handled
- On a periodic timer (every `retryCheckIntervalSec`, default: 30s)

---

## Workspace State Machine

```
        create()
idle ──────────────→ running
                         │
              exitCode==0 │ exitCode!=0
                    ↓     ↓
                  done   failed → (retry: back to running)
```

State transitions are performed by the Orchestrator only.

  start()   → void   // start HTTP server, run startup sync, begin accepting webhooks
  stop()    → void   // graceful shutdown (SIGTERM)
  status()  → OrchestratorRuntimeState  // read-only current state
}
```
