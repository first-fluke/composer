# Symphony Dev Template

**A stack-agnostic development harness for AI coding agent orchestration, built on the [OpenAI Symphony SPEC](https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/SPEC.md).**

> Read this in: [한국어](./README.ko.md)

---

## What is this?

This repository is a **ready-to-use project template** for teams that want to run AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, etc.) on software engineering tasks at scale.

Inspired by OpenAI's [Harness Engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) approach — 3 engineers, 5 months, ~1 million lines of code, zero manually written lines, 3.5 PRs per engineer per day — this template gives you the scaffolding to replicate that workflow.

The template is **stack-agnostic**. Architecture principles, documentation, CI, and agent harness are all in place. You choose the implementation language (TypeScript, Python, or Go) and fill in `src/` when you're ready.

## Core Concept

```
Linear Issue (In Progress)
        │
        ▼
  Orchestrator  ──polls──▶  Linear GraphQL API
        │
        ▼  (per issue)
  WorkspaceManager  ──creates──▶  git worktree  {WORKSPACE_ROOT}/{issue-key}/
        │
        ▼
  AgentRunner  ──spawns──▶  codex serve  (stdin: rendered WORKFLOW.md prompt)
        │
        ▼
  Agent works in isolated worktree, commits, opens PR
        │
        ▼
  CI passes  →  human reviews architecture only  →  merge  →  worktree GC
```

**Key principle:** Symphony is a scheduler/runner. It never writes to Linear. Agents do.

## Installation

Composer works for both **new projects** (full scaffold) and **existing projects** (harness overlay only). The installer auto-detects which mode to use.

### New project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/first-fluke/composer.git my-project
cd my-project
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer copies the full scaffold: harness core, `src/`, `scripts/dev.sh`, and optionally `.github/` CI workflows.

### Existing project

Run the installer from your project root — no cloning required:

```bash
cd your-existing-project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first-fluke/composer/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**What gets installed on an existing project:**

| Item | Action |
|---|---|
| `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `docs/` | Copied in (harness core) |
| `scripts/harness/gc.sh`, `validate.sh` | Copied in |
| `WORKFLOW.md`, `.env.example` | Copied in |
| `AGENTS.md` | Appended if exists, created if not |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `@AGENTS.md` import added if missing |
| `.gitignore` | Missing entries appended (never overwritten) |
| `src/`, `scripts/dev.sh` | **Skipped** |
| `.github/` | **Optional** — asked interactively |

### After installation

**1. Configure `.env`**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

Required values:

```bash
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LINEAR_TEAM_ID=ACR
LINEAR_TEAM_UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
LINEAR_WORKFLOW_STATE_IN_PROGRESS=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
LINEAR_WORKFLOW_STATE_DONE=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
LINEAR_WORKFLOW_STATE_CANCELLED=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
WORKSPACE_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/workspaces
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

**How to find Linear UUIDs:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_LINEAR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query":"{ teams { nodes { id key name } } }"}' | jq .

curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_LINEAR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query":"{ workflowStates { nodes { id name type } } }"}' | jq .
```

**2. Validate**

```bash
./scripts/harness/validate.sh
```

**3. Scaffold a Symphony implementation**

Ask your AI agent:

```
Read AGENT_SETUP.md and scaffold a Symphony implementation using [TypeScript/Python/Go].
```

Or use the built-in Claude Code skill:

```
/symphony-scaffold
```

## The 7 Symphony Components

| # | Component | Responsibility | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Workflow Loader** | Parse `WORKFLOW.md` — YAML front matter + prompt body | `docs/specs/workflow-loader.md` |
| 2 | **Config Layer** | Typed config object + `$VAR` environment variable resolution | `docs/specs/config-layer.md` |
| 3 | **Issue Tracker Client** | Linear GraphQL adapter — fetch in-progress issues | `docs/specs/tracker-client.md` |
| 4 | **Orchestrator** | Polling loop, state machine, retry queue, single in-memory state authority | `docs/specs/orchestrator.md` |
| 5 | **Workspace Manager** | Per-issue `git worktree` creation, lifecycle hooks, GC | `docs/specs/workspace-manager.md` |
| 6 | **Agent Runner** | Spawn `codex serve`, JSON-RPC over stdio, timeout enforcement | `docs/specs/agent-runner.md` |
| 7 | **Observability** | Structured JSON logs (stdout), optional status HTTP surface, optional OTEL | `docs/specs/observability.md` |

### Domain Models

All components share these domain models (defined in `docs/specs/domain-models.md`):

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `Issue` | Linear issue data — read-only, never written by Symphony |
| `Workspace` | Per-issue isolated working directory (`{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/{key}/`) |
| `RunAttempt` | Single agent execution record (start, finish, exit code, output) |
| `LiveSession` | Active process heartbeat tracker (for orphan detection on restart) |
| `RetryEntry` | Failed issue retry schedule (exponential backoff) |
| `OrchestratorRuntimeState` | In-memory state owned exclusively by Orchestrator |

**Workspace key derivation:** `issue.identifier` with all characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` replaced by `_`.

---

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Layers

```
Presentation   — CLI, HTTP handler. No business logic.
    ↓
Application    — Orchestrator, WorkspaceManager. Coordinates via interfaces.
    ↓
Domain         — Issue, Workspace, RunAttempt. Pure rules, zero external deps.
    ↓
Infrastructure — LinearApiClient, FileSystem, Git, Logger. Adapters only.
```

Dependency arrows point **downward only**. See `docs/architecture/LAYERS.md`.

### Key Forbidden Patterns

1. No framework/ORM imports in Domain layer
2. No business logic in Router/Handler
3. No hardcoded secrets — use `.env` only
4. Issue body is untrusted — sanitize before inserting into prompts
5. No file exceeding 500 lines
6. No shared mutable state outside Orchestrator
7. No errors without fix instructions

Full list with examples: `docs/architecture/CONSTRAINTS.md`

### Automated Enforcement

```bash
./scripts/harness/validate.sh    # Runs before every commit and in CI
```

| Stack | Tool | Config |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | dependency-cruiser | `docs/architecture/enforcement/typescript.md` |
| Python | import-linter + Ruff | `docs/architecture/enforcement/python.md` |
| Go | golangci-lint + go vet | `docs/architecture/enforcement/go.md` |

## WORKFLOW.md — The Symphony Contract

`WORKFLOW.md` is a single file that defines both the orchestrator configuration and the agent prompt template.

```yaml
---
# YAML front matter: orchestrator config
tracker:
  type: linear
  api_key: $LINEAR_API_KEY
  team_id: $LINEAR_TEAM_ID
  poll_interval_seconds: 30
  workflow_states:
    in_progress: $LINEAR_WORKFLOW_STATE_IN_PROGRESS
    done: $LINEAR_WORKFLOW_STATE_DONE
    cancelled: $LINEAR_WORKFLOW_STATE_CANCELLED

workspace:
  root: $WORKSPACE_ROOT
  cleanup_after_days: 7

agent:
  command: "codex"
  args: ["serve"]
  timeout_seconds: 3600
  max_retries: 3

## Harness Engineering Principles

This template implements the 5 core principles from OpenAI's Harness Engineering:

### 1. Context Engineering
`AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for all agents (static context). Logs and metrics provide dynamic context. Agents read `AGENTS.md` before starting any task.

### 2. Architecture Constraints
Dependency direction linters run on every commit and in CI. Bad patterns are caught mechanically, not by code review. See `docs/architecture/CONSTRAINTS.md`.

### 3. Application Legibility
Each issue gets an isolated `git worktree`. Agents can't interfere with each other's work. Optional Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) support for browser-based tasks. See `docs/harness/LEGIBILITY.md`.

### 4. Entropy Management
A weekly GC agent (`scripts/harness/gc.sh`, automated via `.github/workflows/harness-gc.yml`) cleans stale worktrees and branches. "AI Slop" (duplicate code, unused imports) is prevented through linter rules and conventions. See `docs/harness/ENTROPY.md`.

### 5. Merge Philosophy
Short-lived PRs. CI pass = merge ready. Human review focuses on architecture gate-keeping only. See `docs/harness/FEEDBACK-LOOPS.md`.

## AI Agent Skills

### Built-in Symphony Skills

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `symphony-scaffold` | "scaffold symphony for [stack]" | Full project setup for chosen stack |
| `symphony-component` | "implement [component name]" | Single Symphony component implementation |
| `symphony-conformance` | "audit symphony" / "check conformance" | SPEC compliance audit report |
| `harness-gc` | "run gc" / "clean worktrees" | Guided worktree garbage collection |

### Claude Code Sub-agents

| Agent | Description |
|---|---|
| `symphony-architect` | Architecture decisions, SPEC interpretation, layer boundary questions |
| `symphony-implementer` | Feature implementation with preflight architecture check |
| `symphony-reviewer` | Code review using PR template as framework |

### Other oh-my-agent Skills

`backend-agent`, `frontend-agent`, `db-agent`, `debug-agent`, `qa-agent`, `pm-agent`, `commit`, `brainstorm`, and more — all stack-agnostic via the shared `_shared/` protocols.

---

## Security

### Prompt Injection Defense
- `WORKFLOW.md` is trusted (version-controlled, engineer-authored)
- Issue body (`issue.description`) is always untrusted — sanitized at entry point before inserting into prompts
- Maximum length: 8,000 characters with forbidden pattern removal

### Least Privilege
- Each agent operates only within its assigned worktree (`{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/{key}/`)
- Agents do not push to `main`/`master` directly — PRs only
- No force push

### Secrets Management
- All secrets in `.env` only (gitignored)
- `.env.example` contains key names and descriptions, never values
- Pre-commit hook detects accidental secret commits

### Audit Logs
All agent actions are logged in structured JSON format. See `docs/specs/observability.md` for the full event catalog.

Full security documentation: `docs/harness/SAFETY.md`

---

## Harness Maturity Levels

| Level | Target | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Level 1** (Basic) | New project | `AGENTS.md` with 6 standard sections, pre-commit hooks (lint + basic checks), unit tests with coverage threshold |
| **Level 2** (Team) | Agent team scale | CI architecture constraint validation, AI-aware PR checklist, dependency layer linter in CI |
| **Level 3** (Production) | Enterprise | Custom middleware for agent behavior tracking, full OpenTelemetry stack, automated anomaly alerts |

This template ships at **Level 2** readiness.

---

## CI/CD

### `ci.yml` — Main CI

Triggers on push and PR to `main`.

1. **validate** — runs `./scripts/harness/validate.sh` (secret detection, dangerous patterns, architecture layer violations)
2. **test** — stack-specific test runner (scaffolded; activate after choosing a stack)

### `harness-gc.yml` — Weekly GC

Runs every Sunday at 00:00 UTC (also manually triggerable).

Runs `./scripts/harness/gc.sh` to:
- Remove worktrees/branches older than 30 days (configurable via `GC_DAYS`)
- Soft-delete first (`.gc-flagged` marker), hard-delete on the next cycle

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install (requires pre-commit)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Hooks: trailing whitespace, YAML/JSON syntax, secret detection (`detect-secrets`), Ruff (Python), ESLint (TS), golangci-lint (Go), `validate.sh`.

---

## Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Time to PR** | Issue assigned → PR created |
| **CI pass rate** | PRs that pass CI on the first run |
| **Review time per PR** | Average human reviewer time per PR |
| **Doc freshness** | Days since `AGENTS.md` last updated (flag if > 30 days) |
